# obsidian-colored-underline

Select the text you want to underline and use the default hotkey `CTRL+U` to underline it (default color is blue).

You can change the color fast by using the command palette (`CTRL+P`) and chose from the 4 most common colors:
- Red ðŸŸ¥
- Blue ðŸŸ¦
- Green ðŸŸ©
- Yellow ðŸŸ¨

Or you can change in the settings of a custom color of your liking (any available in CSS).
