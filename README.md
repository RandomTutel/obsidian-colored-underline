# obsidian-colored-underline

Select the text you want to underline and use the default hotkey `CTRL+U` to underline it.

You can quickly change the color using the command palette (`CTRL+P`) and choose from the four most common options:
- Red ðŸŸ¥
- Blue ðŸŸ¦
- Green ðŸŸ©
- Yellow ðŸŸ¨

Or customize your own color in the plugin settings (any color available via CSS).

This plugin is especially useful for users who prefer the classic way of highlighting text.

I hope you enjoy it!
